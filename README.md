# Intola
Ecommerce mobile application for shopping, delivering and donating to people in need.

# Getting Started

We've made use of Datastax ASTRA DB(Cassandra Database as a service), Nodejs, Express, for the server side. For the client side, we used Google's UI framework, Flutter. To ensure that customers transactions are processed smoothly, promptly and safely,  we've made use of Flutterwave , a payment service provider.
